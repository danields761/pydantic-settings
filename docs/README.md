Library which extends [pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic) functionality in scope of application settings. *Pydantic* already have settings
implementation, e.g. `pydantic.BaseSettings`, but from my point it's missing some useful features:

1. Overriding settings values by environment variables even for nested fields
2. Providing detailed information about value location inside a loaded file or environment variable, which helps to point user mistake
3. Documenting model fields isn't feels comfortable, but it's really essential to write comprehensive documentation for application settings

> __NOTE:__ Beta quality

## Installation

Using pip:

```sh
pip install pydantic-settings
```

## Usage example

### Override values by env variables

Allows to override values for nested fields if they are represented as *pydantic* model.

Here is example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/override_by_env.py
    :language: python


### Point exact error location inside file

.. literalinclude:: examples/loc_inside_text_content.py
    :language: python


### Extracts fields documentation

Allows to extract *Sphinx* style attributes documentation by processing AST tree of class definition

.. literalinclude:: examples/attr_docs_example.py
    :language: python


### Online docs

## Development setup

Project requires [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) for development setup.

* If you aren't have it already

```sh
pip install poetry
``` 

* Install project dependencies

```sh
poetry install
```

* Run tests

```sh
poetry run pytest .
```

* Great, all works! Expect one optional step:

* Install [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) for pre-commit hooks

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

That will install pre-commit hooks, which will check code with *flake8* and *black*.

> *NOTE* project uses __black__ as code formatter, but i'am personally really dislike their
> *"double quoted strings everywhere"* style, that's why `black -S` should be used
> (anyway it's configured in *pyproject.toml* file)
